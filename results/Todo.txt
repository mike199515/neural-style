0.[Done] Refactor the code to support the following requirements.

1. [Done] Run image of apple with mixing features horizontally. w/o normalization.

2. [Done] Run the image with horizontally mixed features, but the first two layers  are only mixture of styles. ¡ª hybrid setting.

3. [Done] Run image of apple with mixing factor [0.5,0.5] for all layers, and also factor [1,0],[1,0],[0,1],[0,1] for the four layers. (Show how the mixing affects.)

4. [Done] Run image of apple without using normalization technique in mixing examples. i.e., checkout to former version and do the experiments. (Show how normalization helps)

5. In the report, remove the part about colorization and change words accordingly.
